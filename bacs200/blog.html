        <h1>Responses to the Pandemic</h1>

            <h3>Remain safe, take precaution</h3>
            <p>While the pandemic has been going on for quite some time, we are still not in the clear. Multiple studies show that trying to rush getting back to how things were pre-pandemic only worsens the pandemic for everyone else.</p>
            <p>The 2 week lock-down was proof that things were very possible to be under control and taken care of, but negligence of public safety caused things to revert to how they were, or even worsening the pandemic!</p>
            <p>As soon as the vast majority of people get vaccinated and proper precautions are taken, we can finally be out of this. Just a little bit longer is needed to get past this, so there's no reason to rush it.</p>

            <h3>Return to normal ASAP</h3>
            <p>The pandemic in the US has been going on for over a year and a half already, which is far too long! There are clear consequences to this, like not being able to socialize and see family, along with changes in schooling and the workplace.</p>
            <p>There is no clear end to the pandemic so we might as well get back to normal as soon as possible. The vaccine is already out so there is no reason to hold off on bringing things back to how they were.</p>

            <h3>You have been lied to</h3>
            <p>There is no virus! There is no vaccine! It is all just the government trying to kill us all off! The half-lizard people in the Whitehouse are plotting the next attack on us as we speak!</p>
            <p>Have you ever seen somebody with the so-called "virus"? No, since it's not real! Same with Wyoming, just another conspiracy by the government!</p>
