    <h1 class="text-white bg-dark">Social implications</h1>
    <p>Due to the pandemic, many people are not able to socialize with their friends and family. Not being able to meet up and being forced to social distance has clearly caused people to become frustrated due to it.</p>

    <p>Things like schools were forced to change, some schools having to go completely virtual despite not having any foundation for this kind of learning. Many students had their grades tanked due to the sudden change in the learning style.</p>
    <p>These restrictions also move into everyday life. Simple tasks like going to the grocery store became way harder to do while abiding within the pandemic's restrictions.</p>
    <p>Understandably so, people want to ignore the pandemic and still socialize with others, but it is important to still follow the guidelines so everyone can get out of this as soon as possible.</p>

    <h1 class="text-white bg-dark">Economic implications</h1>
    <p>Obviously with quarantine and social distancing guidelines, being able to work becomes much more difficult than it was before. Some workplaces were forced to go digital if possible, with other places like stores having to stay open.</p>
    <p>Some stores like grocery stores starting leaning further into ordering online and either getting it delivered or being able to pick up from a location. Some other stores were not able to do so well, especially smaller businesses which were forced to close.</p>
    <p>On the side of the consumer, this got tiring very quick - while there were more options for getting your things delivered, including food, the delivery charges started to add up for many people. Combining that with the fact that many people couldn't work made it only much harder.</p>
