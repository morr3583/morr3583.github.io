    <p>André 3000, famous musician known for his catchy choruses, smooth rhymes, and storytelling second to none, is my biggest inspiration.</p>
    <p>He has released multiple albums under the group 'OutKast', comprised of him and Big Boi.</p>
    <p>Not only are his songs amazing but he is a genuinely great person, being a vegan for almost 15 years and supporting several movements, such as BLM.</p>
